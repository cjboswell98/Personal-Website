           <strong>Origin Story</strong>
           <p>I was born and raised an inner city kid, and have always been one until middle school. 
               Growing up in Detroit isn’t the most glorified thing that exists in the world. In fact, 
               I am an individual who did not come from a privileged background. I had to use my athletic 
               ability in order to achieve success in my life because my parents could not afford a way for 
               me to get a higher education.  </p>

           <strong>Time Away</strong>
           <p>Football and being an athlete in general, has opened so many doors for me and I was able to use my talents, as a tool in order to get to where I am today. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend two out of state universities to better myself as a person, one being a Big 10 university, and the other being a Public Ivy League university. I got a totally different perspective than most children from Michigan. Not many people I grew up with had the opportunity. I was able to learn important life skills, and experiences that allows me to come back to my hometown and not only better myself and my family, but to make a difference within my community as well! </p>

           <strong>Promising Future</strong>
           <p>The future of my city is bright. Going away to college forced me to gain different insight on my hometown. Detroit, and the downtown area in particular hasn’t always seen the brightest days when I was young mostly due to poverty and a lack of value in the city as a whole. Only until recently, the city of Detroit has been making tremendous strides towards a major rebuild and I am very excited to see it. Going away to college, and coming back after graduation, I noticed every bit of rejuvenation within the city. Almost feels like a new one entirely!</p>
